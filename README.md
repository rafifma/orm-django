# ORM in Django

This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** in Django ‚Äî exploring database models, queries, and relationships ‚Äî created as part of a university seminar on *Advanced Data and Information Management Technologies*.

## üìñ Overview
The project is a practical implementation of Django ORM concepts, based on hands-on coding practice and inspired by the Django full course by **Mosh Hamedani**.  
It serves as both an academic exercise and a personal learning project to deepen understanding of how Django handles data persistence and database abstraction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Django** (latest version used in the course)
- **SQLite3** (default Django database) ‚Äî managed and visualized using **DataGrip**
- HTML/CSS (for basic template rendering)

## ‚ú® Features
- Creating and managing Django models
- Defining fields and model relationships:
  - One-to-One
  - One-to-Many
  - Many-to-Many
- Performing CRUD operations via ORM
- QuerySets and filtering data
- Using Django Admin to manage records
- Applying migrations for schema changes
- Managing database schema and data using DataGrip

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rafifma/orm-django.git
   cd orm-django
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
    ```bash
